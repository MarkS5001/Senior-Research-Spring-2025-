abstract = {Unsupported and silica-supported amorphous metal-boron materials (Ni-B, Mo-O-B, and Ni-Mo-O-B) were prepared by NaBH4 reduction of aqueous or impregnated metal salts. The resulting materials were characterized by a range of techniques, including conventional and time-resolved X-ray diffraction. The latter technique was used to determine the onset of crystallization of the amorphous materials during annealing in He flow and to identify the phases formed. Annealing of unsupported Ni-B resulted in the crystallization of predominantly Ni3B, followed by Ni metal, whereas Ni-B/SiO2 formed Ni and then NiO. There was no evidence for crystallization of B-containing phases for Mo-O-B or Mo-O-B/SiO2 on annealing; instead, the predominant phase formed was MoO2. In general, the phases formed for Ni-Mo-O-B and Ni-Mo-O-B/SiO2 were consistent with those formed in the monometallic materials, but at higher annealing temperatures. Catalysts prepared by sulfiding Ni-B/SiO2 and Ni-Mo-O-B/SiO2 materials had significantly higher thiophene HDS activities than conventionally prepared sulfided Ni/SiO2 and Ni-Mo/SiO2 catalysts, whereas a sulfided Mo-O-B/SiO2 catalyst had a dramatically lower HDS activity than a sulfided Mo/SiO2 catalyst.}

ABSTRACT = {Compressive strength testing is usually the first test applied to alkali-activated materials or geopolymers after their manufacture to gauge the success of the selected formulation. If the compressive strength is found to be acceptable, then a raft of other tests can be applied to assess the suitability of the geopolymer for its anticipated application. It is proposed that a rapid X-ray diffraction (XRD) test can provide an indication of the strength of geopolymers via the measurement of the difference between the amorphous precursor peak position and the position of the amorphous peak of the geopolymer material. The proposed XRD method provides complementary data to mechanical strength testing and provides evidence that a geopolymer has formed.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of the glancing incidence X-ray diffraction configuration to depth profile surface phase transformations is of interest to pharmaceutical scientists. The Parratt equation has been used to depth profile phase changes in pharmaceutical compacts. However, it was derived to calculate 1/e penetration at glancing incident angles slightly below the critical angle of condensed matter and is, therefore, applicable to surface studies of materials such as single crystalline nanorods and metal thin films. When the depth of interest is 50–200 µm into the surface, which is typical for pharmaceutical solids, the 1/e penetration depth, or skin depth, can be directly calculated from an exponential absorption law without utilizing the Parratt equation. In this work, we developed a more relevant method to define X-ray penetration depth based on the signal detection limits of the X-ray diffractometer. Our definition of effective penetration depth was empirically verified using bilayer compacts of varying known thicknesses of mannitol and lactose. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 99:3807–3814, 2010},

abstract = {In this work, we present a method to obtain quantitative information about the thickness of thin, polycrystalline layers. This non-destructive method is based on Glancing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) experiments at different incidence angles. At different incidence angles, information about phases lying at different depths is obtained. The diffracted X-ray intensities' dependence on the glancing angle was analyzed and compared with simulations performed by means of a simple optico-geometrical model taking into account the Fresnel coefficients, X-ray absorption, and the effective scattered volume. The depth profile of polycrystalline Au layers was evaluated to test the procedure. The results of the GIXRD and the simulations are in very good agreement with the thickness obtained by means of X-ray reflectivity (XRR) technique.}
